Objective:
To learn how Tries work and how to implement this functionality.

public void insert(String key)
This function will insert the given key key into the trie at the correct position. You
need to create the necessary non-leaf nodes to structure it correctly.

public boolean contains(String key)
This function will determine if a node with the given key key exists. If the node
exist, return true, otherwise return false.

public void printKeyList()
This function will print all the keys in the trie in alphabetical order. The printed
list will be terminated by a newline char. The charset used by the
trie is in alphabetical order.
