Objectives
To learn how to implement and use efficient sorting algorithms.


void heapsort(T[] data, boolean debug)
The array data[] contains a list of unsorted objects, that needs to be sorted
in place. The parameter debug enables output for marking purposes. 

void mergesort(T[] data, int first, int last, boolean debug)
The array data[] contains a list of unsorted objects, that needs to be sorted
in place. The parameters first and last indicate the beginning and end of the portion
of the data[] array that needs to be sorted at a specific invocation.
